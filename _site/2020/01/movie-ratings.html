                <h1><a href="/2020/01/movie-ratings">Jan 6, 2020 - Using Natural Language Processing to Score Movie Reviews</a></h1>
            
            <div class="post-content">
            <p>The idea to create a potential improvement over Rotten Tomatoes’ method of aggregating movie reviews has been kicking around in my head for a few years, but it wasn’t until I learned Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that I was really able to implement the idea.  Rotten Tomatoes creates its 
aggregated movie review scores by assigning a binary sentiment
label to each review for a film (“fresh” for positive and “rotten” for
negative) and taking an average of the
binary scores to come up with an aggregated score between 0% and
100%.  For example, if a movie’s reviews were all mildly positive, Rotten
Tomatoes would assign a sentiment of positive to every review,
resulting in a score of 100%. In contrast, if a movie had very polarizing
reviews, for example, 50 very positive and 50 very negative
reviews, this methodology would result in a potentially misleading
50% aggregated score.</p>

<p>My idea is that rather than use a binary sentiment classification, a continuous score between 0 and 1.0 can be assigned to each movie review.  The aggregate score would then be based on an average of these ratings.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many publications do not append handy scores to their reviews in order to use them in aggregation. Human taggers can read each review
and assign a score based on the content of the review; however, this is extremely inefficient when hundreds of movies are released each year and many publications write reviews of these movies. This is
where NLP comes in: machine learning can be used automatically assign a review score based on the text content of the headline and review, and that is exactly what I did.</p>

<p>In order to test a number of methods, I used three different types of models: a simple linear regression model, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model and a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) model.  The linear regression model used term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to convert the review text into numerical features a model could use.  The RNN and CNN models both used word embeddings (learned during model training) to convert the text into model features.</p>

<p>All models were trained on a subset of data from the [Stanford Network Analysis Project] (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html), which consists of approximately 8 million Amazon user reviews of over 250,000 movies.  Once the models were trained, I tested it on actual movie reviews from newspaper and websites for four movies and created individual review and aggregate review scores for the four movies.</p>

<p>The full code for this project can be found as a Jupyter notebook <a href="https://github.com/edeckter/movie_ratings/blob/master/Deckter_CS584_Project.ipynb">here</a>.  In addition, there is a paper describing the full experiment and the results <a href="https://github.com/edeckter/movie_ratings/blob/master/Deckter_CS584_ProjectReport.pdf">here</a>.</p>
