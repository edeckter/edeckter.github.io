HELLO! This is a repository where I am posting data science and data visualization projects to the web.

I will include and/or cite the data sources so that others can recreate and follow along with my work.

This site was built using the [Jekyll Clean]((https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean) theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
