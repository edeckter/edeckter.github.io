I was tasked with creating an interactive visualization for my Data Visualization class.  For this project, I decided to create data visualizations that would allow a user to explore the box office results for 2018.

Data Preparation
================
US domestic box office gross sales were pulled for every movie for every day in 2018 using the boxoffice package in R.  Data were pulled from [the-numbers](http://www.the-numbers.com) website.  Supplemental information on each film released in 2018 (such as MPAA rating and IMDB rating) were pulled from the [Internet Movie Database](http://www.imdb.com) using the [IMDbPy](https://imdbpy.sourceforge.io/) package in Python.

Once the data had been pulled through the R and Python APIs, Excel was used to manipulate and aggregate the data.  The data files were saved in csv formats for use in the visualizations.

Visualization
==============
I chose to use D3 for my visualizations because (a) it allowed the most flexibility in design and layout of my visualizations and (b) it was a great opportunity to practice (and expand) my new D3 skills.

The main component of this project is an area chart, showing the US domestic box office for each day in 2018.
